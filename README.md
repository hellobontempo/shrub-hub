# Welcome to Shrub Hub.
A web application to organize your plant collection or to learn more about plants! Hang out and stay a while, play the memory game while you're at it. 

## Getting Started
Run `bundle install` to get all of the necessary gems. Before getting started run `rails db:migrate` and `rails db:seed` to set up the database. As more plants are added to the database feel free to change the difficulty of the memory game. In `index.js` on line 113, simply fill in the number of cards you would like created from the plants in your database. The current function `plantApi.getPlants(8)` takes 8 cards and duplcates them in the `class PlantApi` - but this number can go up to however many plants are in your database
